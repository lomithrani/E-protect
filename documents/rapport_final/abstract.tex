\chapter{Abstract :}

E-protect is a home alarm system connected, easy to install and configure. To propose a least expensive system possible, E-protect is based on the elimination of intermediate and uses a network of smart sensors in a meshe network, playing on the connection of sensors between them. The installation of the E-protect components system is easier than a spun alarm system. No need to punch the walls or install the drivers, which dramatically reduces installation costs.\\

In Hardware side, an alarm unit manages a fleet of sensors connected with meshed topology (ZigBee / Bluetooth Low Energy / CSRmesh). The alarm is deactivated when the customer enters in the house (or through mobile application). The alarm is as unobtrusive as possible and interacted with the software part (SigFox / Ethernet).\\

A mobile application and website allow to keep the client informed of the alarm's state. In addition the customer can set up the remote alarm (Ap- plication Android / iOS / Windows Phone, Javascript / PHP / C \# / SQL).\\

E-protect maintain continuous contact between the client and home.\\

E-protect system is :\\

\begin{itemize}
\item Smartphone Application to monitor, modify, enable or disable remote system ;
\item System Interface ;
\item A personalized website with the same Smartphone application function ;
\item A backup system in case of failure of the power grid ;
\item An innovative and modular sensor design according to customer's will ;
\item Very low power consumption, based on a power demand reduced due the use of a meshed network\\
\end{itemize}
